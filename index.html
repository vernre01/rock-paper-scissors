		1. At this point you should still just be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.

		2. Use prompt() to get input from the user.

		3. Feel free to re-work your previous functions if you need to. Specifically, you might want to change the return value to something more useful.

		4. Feel free to create more “helper” functions if you think it would be useful.
